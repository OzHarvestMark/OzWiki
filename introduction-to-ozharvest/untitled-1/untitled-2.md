# NEST

NEST is a national education program teaching people in need skills and knowledge to nurture themselves through healthier eating choices and food preparation through a series of hands-on cooking and nutrition workshops.

Designed around the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, participants learn about:

* nutritious healthy eating choices
* low cost meal planning
* budgeting
* reading food labels
* correct food storage
* shopping and cooking tips
* minimising food waste

The NEST program is facilitated on-site and flexible in delivery, workshops can be tailored for cultural and dietary requirements.

Training is also offered to staff, cooks and volunteers at charitable organisations, to help increase understanding and improve skills on using food delivered by OzHarvest or to support existing programs already in place. After each workshop, participants share a nourishing meal together encouraging social inclusiveness and enhance community connections.

### **ALEX’S STORY**

When Alex joined a NEST workshop, he was unsure where his life was heading and what opportunities were available to him. He had been living on the streets, and in his car prior to securing temporary accommodation. Through NEST he discovered a love of cooking, where he showed natural talent and decided to aim for a job within the food industry.

Initially, Alex volunteered with OzHarvest assisting with food rescue and at Cooking for a Cause events, over a few months he learnt as much as he could from the talented chefs and even led a NEST class to cook up the most delicious Pad Thai \(a family recipe\). Alex’s energy and enthusiasm impressed everyone he crossed paths with, including top chef Vincent Lim who decided to hire him to work in his kitchen at the amazing new Perth restaurant, Laputa.
