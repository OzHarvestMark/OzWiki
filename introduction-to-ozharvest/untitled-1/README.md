# What We Do

OzHarvest is Australia’s leading food rescue organisation, collecting quality excess food from commercial outlets and delivering it directly to more than 1300 charities supporting people in need across the country.

Founded in 2004 by Ronni Kahn, after noticing the huge volume of good food going to waste from the hospitality industry, she decided there had to be a better way.  Starting in Sydney with one van – the first of many donations from Goodman+ Foundation – she delivered 4,000 meals in the first month.

OzHarvest now operates nationally, rescuing over 180 tonnes of food each week from over 3,500 food donors including supermarkets, hotels, airports, wholesalers, farmers, corporate events, catering companies, shopping centres, delis, cafes, restaurants, film and TV shoots and boardrooms.

Education is crucial to our business to help enable positive change for vulnerable people. Check out OzHarvest’s education programs, [**NEST** ](https://www.ozharvest.org/what-we-do/nest-nutrition-education/)and [**Nourish**](https://www.ozharvest.org/nourish/)**.** Our new curriculum-aligned education program [FEAST](https://www.ozharvest.org/what-we-do/feast-food-education-sustainability-training/) for primary school students is currently being piloted, with plans for NSW roll-out in 2019 and nationally in 2020.

We recently opened Australia’s first rescued food supermarket – the [**OzHarvest Market**](https://www.ozharvest.org/market/) in Sydney, based on a ‘take what you need, give if you can’ philosophy. And look out for our new [**OzHarvest Food Truck**](https://www.ozharvest.org/what-we-do/foodtruck/)**,** available for corporate, community and private functions and helping feed communities in need around Sydney.

### OUR PURPOSE IS TO NOURISH OUR COUNTRY.

OzHarvest has **four pillars** that direct the work we do:

* **Rescue**

Eliminating hunger and food waste through the redistribution of quality surplus food underpins everything we do.  Our framework for food rescue now operates from eight cities and through regional communities across Australia, enabling OzHarvest to save millions of kilos of good food from landfill.  

* **Educate**

Education about healthy eating, nutrition, preventing food waste and sustainability is central to our purpose, along with protecting and improving the environment through our actions. Our education programs are designed to increase community connectedness, improve self-worth and confidence and deliver the important food waste and sustainability message. 

* **Engage**

Community engagement is the heartbeat of OzHarvest and continues to grow every day through our devoted team of like-minded partners and our ever growing ‘yellow army’ of volunteers. There’s no better way to experience how we nourish our country than rolling up your sleeves and getting involved. 

* **Innovate**

OzHarvest is constantly looking for new ways and innovative solutions to combat food waste and hunger and use technology to mobilise everyday Australians to take meaningful action. We are proud of the unique for-impact, OzHarvest food rescue model which is being introduced to other countries across the globe.
