# FEAST

FEAST is a new educational program by OzHarvest, designed to teach kids about sustainability, food waste and nutrition using hands-on cooking and inquiry based learning.

Food waste is a global issue causing a negative effect on the environment. Whilst food rescue fills hungry bellies, education transforms lives and is the key to influencing change. Children are the future to saving our planet and we hope to inspire them with this new educational resource providing food education and sustainability training, or FEAST for short!

Like any good FEAST, itâ€™s designed to be fun, engaging and filled with good food! It combines creative cooking, together with nutrition knowledge, healthy eating and food waste prevention to protect the environment and help everyone lead a fully sustainable life.

FEAST extends beyond the classroom, as students develop the skills to become change makers in the community. It embodies our vision to build a world with zero food waste and free of hunger.

The FEAST program is currently in pilot phase and will be rolling out to schools from 2019.
