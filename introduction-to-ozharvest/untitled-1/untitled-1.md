# Nourish

The Nourish Program enables OzHarvest to be part of a special journey for at-risk young people \(16-25 years\) by training and mentoring students in a Certificate II in Hospitality or Kitchen Operations. Nourish offers more than just hospitality skills as it creates hope, opportunity and supports employment pathways for self-sustainability.

Nourish is absolutely FREE for participating students. OzHarvest partners with TAFE NSW in Sydney and Career Employment Group \(CEG\) in Adelaide to deliver a full training program supported by volunteers, mentors and qualified industry professionals. We aim to relaunch Nourish on the Gold Coast early in 2019.

## How does it work?

The program is designed as a stepping stone for participants into the hospitality industry. It covers a range of skills including cooking, coffee making, nutrition, food safety, hygiene, communication, teamwork and job-seeking.

OzHarvest’s growing list of food donors and industry contacts often provide work experience and employment opportunities for Nourish graduates.

### How to get Involved?

There are two intakes of students annually — at the beginning and middle of the year. Due to limited class sizes, we encourage any young people who are interested to register now! Please download the registration form for your location from the relevant link below.
