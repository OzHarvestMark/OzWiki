### Headings

Headings are what structures your documents. Heading levels 1 and 2 will appear in the document's navigation on the right.

All headings have a link near them which is a link that your readers can use to point to a particular section of your documentation.

### Inline image

By default, inline images are sized proportionally to the font size. It's especially great for inline badges and icons, among other things. When inserting an inline image, you can also set it to its "original size". By doing so, the image will remain inline but with its original size until a maximum width. To create an inline image from the "plus" menu appearing when hovering your caret:
